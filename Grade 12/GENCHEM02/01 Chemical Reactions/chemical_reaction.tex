Process of change is written using a Chemical Equation
Reactants -> Products

H2+N2-> NH3

A chemical reaction is a universal language; it is understood by chemists all around the world

Reactions are descriptive and represents everything involved in the reaction.

Equation Toobox

Phases of Substance

solid
liquid
gas
aq substance is dissolved in an aqueos solution

tips:

when translating into a chemical equation, it is best to ask yourself: what reagents are involved?
\subsubsection{Skeletal Equation}
Direct translation of a chemical equation from the word equation

Chemical equation that does not consider the relative amounts of products and reaction .. Unbalanced Equation

\subsection*{Key Words}
\subsubsection{Reactants}
\begin{itemize}
    \item reacts with
    \item combines with
    \item decomposes
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Products}
\begin{itemize}
    \item forms
